Hey Everyone. Welcome to my journey as a Front-End Developer where I am striving to implement my knowledge by doing some projects. It is a truly tough and thorny way but enormously exciting at the same time

# IP_Address_Tracker

### Project Overview:

Inspiration and idea to develop this project came from an IP Address Tracker challenge on the Frontend Mentor website (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ip-address-tracker-I8-0yYAH0). IP Address Tracker app allows getting specific IP information and current user's location based on IP Address that was entered to an input field.

IP_Address_Tracker app is fully responsive, where IP Address location was gotten from IP Geolocation API (https://geo.ipify.org/) and the interactive map was generated from a LeafletJS library (https://leafletjs.com/)and render based on user's input.  

#### Stack of technologies which were used to develop a particular project: 

### HTML/HTML5, CSS3, BEM, JS, Fetch API,  Responsive Web Design, Mobile First Approach.
